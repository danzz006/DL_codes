#DL codes for the training i will be conducting at IST 
#using tensorflow, keras on VScode

## Example 1 Mnist 
Classification

## Example 2 
2a_python array,numpy,loops, if etc
2b_python class, pandas etc

## Example 2.5,2.6 Line eq and perceptron classification
Sigmoid & decision boundry explaination
Linear classification using Perceptron & learning loop 

## Example 3 
Tf initial orientation and keras based classification for linear/nonlinear case
Classical ML (random forest, logistic regression and SVM for classication

## Example 4
Keras machine learning models with Tensorboard and variation of model defination
